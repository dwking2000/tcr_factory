## tcr\_factory

TCR factory is a universal continuous TCR that can create unlimited TCRs using any ERC20 token. Each TCR has a generic "content" field that can include any generic data structure, allowing dapps to filter only the TCRs that are relevant for their dapps, and add metadata to each TCR.

Some of this code is based on the Relevant TCR bonding curves which were based on the Bancor bonding curve formula.
